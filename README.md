Developed the entirety of the frontend of our site. The entire site is done in React using create-react-app. This was a process in which I learned many critical React frontend concepts including enhanced knowledge of Redux, redux-forms and forms in general in React, JWT and many others. As the frontend developed, I would discover existing endpoints which needed more data and communicated with Sean and Christian. Nearly all database changes were discussed as a team since it had large effects on both the backend and the fronted.
